# University Course Management Web Application

The official UofC website currently provides limited information about the courses offered, making it difficult for students to find all the relevant information they need to make informed decisions about their course selections. Students are often required to scroll through hundreds of courses or use external search engines to locate their desired courses, which can be a frustrating and time-consuming process. 

To address this issue, we propose building a centralized database for university administrators to insert and modify course information, allowing students to search for courses more efficiently. In this report, we will discuss the problem in detail, propose a solution, and explain the motivation behind our project.

To address the problem of limited course information for students, we have created a centralized database that allows university administrators to input and modify relevant course information. This information includes course descriptions, schedules, prerequisites, antirequisites, and evaluations by previous students, as well as information on the instructor teaching the course. 
The database is accessible to students through a user-friendly interface, which allows them to search for and compare courses based on various criteria. The search bar includes specific filters, such as course prerequisites, number of credits, and mandatory courses for specific majors, enabling students to find courses efficiently. 

We developed a web page containing a search bar that prompts the user to enter information about the courses they want to search for. After entering keywords and filters, the courses that satisfy all the conditions will appear. 

Each course will initially be displayed as a small block containing the course title and name. After the user selects the course, another webpage with all the course info will appear. The information includes an introduction to the course, a sample of the most recent course outline, course credits, prerequisites, antirequisites, a list of all previous professors who have taught the course, the current professor teaching the course, and their past reviews/experiences. Providing students with complete information regarding the courses.
